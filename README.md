# Sudoku Solver

This repository contains the working files for my blog posts titled 'Sudoku Solver, viewable here: [edpowderham.com](http://edpowderham.com).

# The Project

The aim of this project was to create a programme to solve a Sudoku based off of an initial set of input numbers. The most important outcomes from the project was not the solving of a puzzle solved numerous times before, but instead the demonstration of my problem solving, TDD practices and OOP programming. 


# Outcome

As per the below example, the sudoku solver is now complete. You can read about the hourney [here](http://edpowderham.com)
