# Sudoku Solver

This repository contains the working files for my blog posts titled 'Sudoku Solver, viewable here: (powderham.github.io)[http://powderham.github.io].

# The Project

The aim of this project is to create a programme to solve a Sudoku based off of an initial set of input numbers. The most important outcomes from the project will not be the solving of a puzzle solved numerous times before, but instead be a demonstration of my problem solving, TDD practices and OOP programming.
